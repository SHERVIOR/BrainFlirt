# BrainFlirt - BCI Hackathon Project

## Overview

**BrainFlirt** is a project created for the **BCI Hackathon** organized by **g.tec**, which combines **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** technology with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to measure user engagement through EEG signals and interact with **ChatGPT**.

This project leverages **Python** for data processing and real-time interaction. By analyzing EEG signals, **BrainFlirt** estimates cognitive states such as focus, engagement, and interest, and uses this data to guide conversations with ChatGPT, making the interaction more intuitive and personalized.

## Features

- Real-time **EEG signal analysis** to measure user engagement.
- Integration with **ChatGPT** to interact based on cognitive states.
- Built using **Python**, leveraging popular libraries for signal processing and AI integration.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Muse 2** for signal collection.
- **MNE** for EEG data processing.
- **OpenAI API** for ChatGPT interaction.
- Other dependencies (listed below).
